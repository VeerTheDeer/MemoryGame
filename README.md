# MemoryGame
Memory Game that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Before this project I was completely unfamiliar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
However after researching online and wanting to make a memory game as a project I used these resources to teach myself this language so that I could make this game

Khan Academy - https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming

This resource helped me with getting familiar with all three languages, such as basic shape creation, and basic animations.

YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GTMOmRrqkU

There are many other smaller youtube videos that I watched which would help me with understanding how these three languages were linked together. However this video was the one that would help me grasp how to start on a basic level.

MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

This resources was great at walking through how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a more detailed level. Some examples are how I learned more about padding and how to design interactables. Also finding additional resources such as pattern.monster (website that allows you to make patterns). For HTML, I learned more advanced animations and the many variables related. Additionally I learned about interactibles and to code in a way that would link to the JS file. JavaScript was by far the hardest to learn out of the three languages because I have only written Java. I learned about the technical functionalities that were related to the project and the basic functionalities that would be essential for any JS file.
